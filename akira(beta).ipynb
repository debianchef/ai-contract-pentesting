It includes functionality for staking NRN tokens, updating battle records, and claiming NRN rewards. The second contract, StakeAtRisk, manages the NRN tokens that are at risk of being lost during a round of competition. It allows users to reclaim NRNs from the stake at risk, as well as update the stake at risk records for a fighter. The third contract, MergingPool, allows users to potentially earn a new fighter NFT by merging their existing fighters. It includes functionality for adding merging pool points, selecting winners, and claiming rewards.\\n\\nThe potential bug in the first contract, RankedBattle, is that it does not check whether the user has already claimed NRNs for a given round before allowing them to claim again. This could allow a user to claim NRNs multiple times for the same round, which is not intended.\\n\\nTo fix this bug, we can add a check in the claimNRN() function to ensure that the user has not already claimed NRNs for the current round. We can do this by checking the numRoundsClaimed mapping to see if the user has claimed NRNs for the current round. If they have, we can revert the transaction and prevent them from claiming again.\\n\\nThe fixed code for the claimNRN() function would look like this:\\n\\n```\\nfunction claimNRN() external {\\n    require(numRoundsClaimed[msg.sender] < roundId, \\\"Already claimed NRNs for this period\\\");\\n    uint256 claimableNRN = 0;\\n    uint256 nrnDistribution;\\n    uint32 lowerBound = numRoundsClaimed[msg.sender];\\n    for (uint32 currentRound = lowerBound; currentRound < roundId; currentRound++) {\\n        nrnDistribution = getNrnDistribution(currentRound);\\n        claimableNRN += (\\n            accumulatedPointsPerAddress[msg.sender][currentRound] * nrnDistribution   \\n        ) / totalAccumulatedPoints[currentRound];\\n        numRoundsClaimed[msg.sender] += 1;\\n    }\\n    if (claimableNRN > 0) {\\n        amountClaimed[msg.sender] += claimableNRN;\\n        _neuronInstance.mint(msg.sender, claimableNRN);\\n        emit Claimed(msg.sender, claimableNRN);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWith this fix, the contract will prevent users from claiming NRNs multiple times for the same round, ensuring that the NRN rewards are distributed fairly among all participants.\"\n",

Some examples include the Solidity documentation, the OpenZeppelin Security Guidelines, and the ConsenSys Diligence Best Practices for Smart Contract Security.\n> * **Perform thorough testing:** Testing your code thoroughly can help you to identify and fix bugs before they are deployed to a live network. This includes both unit testing and integration testing.\n> * **Use a multi-sig wallet for sensitive operations:** If your contract has sensitive operations, such as transferring large amounts of funds, you should consider using a multi-sig wallet to require multiple signatures for these operations.\n> \n> By following these recommendations, you can help to improve the security and reliability of your Solidity code."
